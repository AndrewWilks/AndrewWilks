# Andrew Wilks — Full-Stack Software Developer

Brisbane-based dev moving from Power Platform into **full-stack engineering**.
I build with **React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**, and I care
about clean UX, reliable APIs, and CI/CD. I ship working code and short, practical write-ups.

- 🔭 Building now:
  - **Portfolio Tracker** — dividends, CSV import, goals & projections
  - **Dev Standards** — reusable ESLint/TS/testing/changelog presets
  - **SaaS Starter** — Next.js template with Auth.js + RBAC + tests
- 🎯 2025 focus: ship public code, tighten testing, and land a full-stack role
- 📚 Studying: **PL-200 → PL-400 → AZ-204** (developer + cloud path)

## What I'm shipping (public roadmap)

- [ ] **Website (Payload + Next.js)** — Projects, Case Studies, Contact
- [ ] **Dev Standards (monorepo)** — eslint/tsconfig/commitlint/testing presets; CI templates
- [ ] **Portfolio Tracker (Next + Node + Postgres)** — auth + CRUD → CSV import → projections → goals
- [ ] **Quick Win** — small, visual app (Weather/Habits/FX) for demos
- [ ] **SaaS Starter** — “Use this template” repo with tests
- [ ] **Node Automation Service** — webhook → queue (BullMQ) → retry/backoff; logs + health

> I prefer to show real code and why I built it. Case studies will land on my site as each project goes live.

## How I work

- Architecture notes/diagrams in `/docs` (Mermaid)
