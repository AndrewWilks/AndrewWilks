# Andrew Wilks — Software Developer

Brisbane-based dev moving from the Microsoft Power Platform into **full‑stack engineering**.  
I build with **React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**, and I care about clean UX, reliable APIs, and CI/CD. I ship working code and short, practical write-ups.

I'm coming from the Power Platform, where I’ve built solutions using Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dataverse. I combine low-code Power Platform experience with modern front-end development (React + TypeScript) and growing back-end skills to deliver end-to-end solutions. I'm actively transitioning my career into full‑stack development.

- 🔭 Building now:
  - **Portfolio Tracker** — dividends, CSV import, goals & projections
  - **Dev Standards** — reusable ESLint/TS/testing/changelog presets
  - **SaaS Starter** — Next.js template with Auth.js + RBAC + tests
- 🎯 2025 focus: ship public code, tighten testing, and land a full-stack role
- 📚 Studying: **PL-200 → PL-400 → AZ-204** (developer + cloud path)
